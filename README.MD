Inside this directory, you will find the Counteroffer Modal and Prism Modal components. Both were fully built by me and use React Native and Typescript. 

The components are divided into cards (or states). One modal, multiple states. The SELLER has three cards and the BUYER has three cards.
The folder called PrismModal, which I also built, is a core "style" component that is used by the Counteroffer Modal to match modals across the site. 

Very nice speaking with both of you and please let me know if you have any questions!
